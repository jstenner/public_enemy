JBL - ECW One Night Stand 2006 F*** YOU SMACKDOWN! F*** YOU SMACKDOWN Watch what you say about SmackDown. Don't you bring your dog & pony show. Don't you bring your backyard quality wrestling show into JBL's town of New York, and embarrass this business. Hey, wait a minute. ECW. I recognize that ring ... YOU SUCK DICK! YOU SUCK DICK! I see no women here and you're chanting about a male organ. Now tell me who's the fruit-booty? I sat in that ring right there last year. One year ago everybody's going hardcore, hardcore. While a certain fat, blue piece of crap sat there and bled and cried. Then what happened? You guys get on your internet and say JBL is a bully. JBL is a bad guy. You know what happened to me? Do you know what happened to me when I knocked one of your boys out? Knocked his fat ass out? You know what happened to me? Nothing. You know why? Because there's not an ECW guy nor a man alive that can do anything to me. Sounds to me like I am the King of hardcore. And Big Show. Kurt Angle. They are our stars. Rob Van Dam made his name in the WWE. He is a star. But he is a star because of people like me. He is a star because of SmackDown. He is a star because of Vince McMahon. And Tazz. You're leaving Network television to go to Tuesday nights on the Sci-Fi Channel?! You're a household name, Tazz. Because of us. But how appropriate it is, you bunch of Star Trek little geeks love the Sci-Fi Channel. And now you get your ECW. Ha ha ha ha ha. It's very appropriate.sSHUT THE F*** UP! SHUT THE F*** UP!sRemember this: you paid to see me. I didn't pay to see any one of yousTAZZ: But you weren't even advertisedsTazz, I want to thank you. Because if you hadn't left they would have had to fire you. Because I'm announcing right now: JBL's coming back! I am the voice of Smackdown. What you see on FOX News, what you see on TheStreet.com, what you see on my nationally syndicated radio show. I am the voice of the A-show, and by the way folks - you're in the minor leagues here. I am the voice of Smackdown. And you can take your telephone book with you because I can see over the desk. So go ahead and watch your little show. Go ahead and drink Paul Heyman's Cool-Aid. But know this: the greatest wrestler, the King of Hardcore, the person who says he is: come hell, come high water, come the creek don't rise. I am who I say I am and I am a wrestling god. Now kiss my ass. This show sucks
